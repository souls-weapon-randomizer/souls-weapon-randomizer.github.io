On the room where you are ambushed by ceiling-spiders, right before the dark room with many spiderwebs, there are mushrooms in the middle that will be eaten by the pig, revealing the pickaxe. Tips: Don't lose it's aggro. The best strategy is to stand near your boar, close enough for him to follow you but doesn't attack, because when he attacks he eventually loses aggro. Killing everything which is on the way to the mushrooms is a good idea, maybe even the spiders in the room because he takes a bit time to eat the mushrooms. This will mean killing some enemies at the bottom of the cove enough times to de-spawn them as there is no easy way back up after clearing the level. If the piglet dies you don't need to burn an ascetic to have him spawning again, the mushrooms don't respawn though, even after burning a bonfire ascetic. They are available in regular NG+. The Redeye Ring is invaluable here as the pig will only lose you if you wander ridiculously far away. Once he sees you, he will follow you. Recommended: Clear the path all the way to the bonfire after Magnus and then put on the ring and draw him in. Instead of going down the stairs near the fire, take the cliff area and jump across to where Pate and Creighton fight. The pig will make many unexpected jumps and follow you anyway. After going through the building recommended above you may recall you will end up in the area with the humanoid spider enemies and two basilisks. If the pickaxe drops and you die before you collect it, you can still find it on the ground after respawn.",
